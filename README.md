My name's Sam LaMartina

I'm 26, returning to school for a finance degree. Previously I studied computer engineering at Missouri S&T. Now I'm working towards a bachelor's degree in finance with a CS minor.

My hobbies are reading (mostly fiction. currently I'm reading book 5 of the red rising series) and playing cards of many kinds. I don't really go in for video games.

My plan is to get my degree, move to colorado or anywhere with skiable mountains, and enjoy the rest of my life in relative comfort.
